     * In production, commonly used sinks include the FileSink, various databases, and several pub-sub systems.

     * In production, your application will run in a remote cluster or set of containers. And if it fails,
     * it will fail remotely. The JobManager and TaskManager logs can be very helpful in debugging such failures,
     * but it is much easier to do local debugging inside an IDE, which is something that Flink supports.
     * You can set breakpoints, examine local variables, and step through your code. You can also step into
     * Flinkâ€™s code, which can be a great way to learn more about its internals if you are curious to see
     * how Flink works.
